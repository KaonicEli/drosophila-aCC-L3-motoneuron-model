Single compartmental, ball-and-stick models implemented in XPP and full morphological model in Neuron. Paper correlates anatomical properties with electrophysiological recordings from these hard-to-access neurons. For instance we make predictions about location of the spike initiation zone, channel distributions, and synaptic input parameters.

## Requirements:

XPPAUT 5.99 - http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html

Neuron 7.1 - http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/

jNeuroML - https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML

## Directories:

**[xpp-models/](xpp-models/)**	Isopotential and ball-and-stick models using the XPPAUT simulator.

**[neuron-model/](neuron-model/)** Multicompartmental model using the Neuron simulator. Follow tutorial in the README to get started with model and replicate paper figures.

**[NeuroML2/](NeuroML2/)** Ports of all models to NeuroML2 and LEMS. Includes [OMV tests](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/osb-model-validation) to check for consistency with the original models: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cengique/drosophila-aCC-L3-motoneuron-model.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cengique/drosophila-aCC-L3-motoneuron-model)

## Workflow/history of project:
- Channel data were fit with the Neurofit tool and then re-adjusted with param-fitter in Matlab.
- XPP models were built with these channels and hand-tuned to fit observed f-I, v-I, and delay.
- Neuron model used these channels and some properties of the ball-and-stick model.
- Morphological reconstruction passive parameters were tuned to recorded capacitance responses.
- Channel distribution hand tuned to mimick observed current responses.
